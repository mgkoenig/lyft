## Features 
#### Saving Desk Positions  
The controller can store up to four different desk positions. These positions are easily accessable using the four memory buttons.

#### Display 
The controller is equipped with a 3-digit 7-segment display which allows you to read the current desk height either in centimeters or inch. Furthermore, you can adjust the display brigtness as well as the display-on time. If the shown desk height is not accurate you can adjust the value using the 'level correction' feature by plus/minus 9 centimeters. 
  
#### Audio Signals  
In order to give some acoustic feedback the controller has a build-in audio transducer. The volume of the audio signals can be set in the settings menu but also be disabled.
  
#### Automatic Driving Mode
One of the most useful features is the automatic driving mode which allows you to move the desk to a saved position without holding a button all the time. 

#### Safety Pin 
On the basis of the original controller LYFT also supports a safety pin. The pin is needed to move the desk and to unlock the settings menu for changes. It is fully compatible with the original IKEA safety pin which is provided with the BEKANT desk. 

Further details and how to use these features are described in the [manual](/manual.pdf).
